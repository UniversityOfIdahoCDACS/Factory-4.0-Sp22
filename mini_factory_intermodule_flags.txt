External Flags (e.g. anything that two or more modules may care about knowing)

VGR Driven:

C700 (high) = puck delivered at MPO station, you can just RST this same bit when you've removed the puck and that could serve as an "all clear" flag for delivering a new puck.

 

C701 (low) = The VGR is clear from the MPO pickup's path such that you don't need to worry about any collisions on picking up the puck.  This bit will go high anytime a collision could occur.  You may want to define a similar bit in your MPO space for the converse consideration, for now I'll just assume if C700 hasn't been RST then the MPO could potentially be working in that area.

 

C702 (high) = The VGR has dropped a puck in the SSC color sensor.  Presumable this could be used for verifying a delivery from the train and knowing which bay to store this in for the HBW.  You could RST this bit low once you'd identified the color in the SSC.

C703 (high) = The VGR has dropped a puck at the drain depot.  Only space for one so must be reset by train to load another puck there.



SLD Driven:
 
C1700 (high) = Puck ready for pickup in the Red chute (I can RST once picked up by the VGR).


C1701 (high) = Puck ready for pickup in the White chute (I can RST once picked up by the VGR).

C1702 (high) = Puck ready for pickup in the Blue chute (I can RST once picked up by the VGR).


HBW Driven:

C300 (high) = Puck ready for pickup in the conveyor on the Factory side.  VGR resets when puck is picked up and clear. 

C301 (high) = Empty pallet ready to load in the conveyor on the factory side.  VGR to reset when this has been loaded.
